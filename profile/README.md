## Hi there 👋

### Nakama (仲間 - Japanese)  
*"Someone you are close with, or with whom you do something together."*

Welcome to **Nakama Lab** – where machine learning meets robotics to build collaborative, intelligent systems.

We focus on creating robotic platforms capable of learning to physically collaborate with humans across a wide range of tasks involving kinematics, dynamics, and vision. Our core research centers around **Learning from Demonstration (LfD)**, enabling robots to learn tasks by observing human behavior and replicating it.

### 🌟 What We Do

- 🤖 Develop collaborative robotic systems  
- 🧠 Apply machine learning to real-world manipulation tasks  
- 👨‍🏫 Explore Learning from Demonstration (LfD)  
- 👥 Work together in an agile, flat team structure  

We believe in openness, creativity, and shared growth. There's no rigid hierarchy – just people working together to advance the frontier of robotics.
